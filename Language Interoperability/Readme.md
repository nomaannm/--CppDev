Language interoperability in C++ involves enabling C++ code to interact with code written in other programming languages, such as C, Python, Java, Swift or C#. This can be useful for leveraging libraries, frameworks, or components written in different languages, thereby enhancing the functionality and flexibility of a C++ application. Here are some common techniques and tools used for language interoperability in C++:

1) C++ is designed to be largely compatible with C. You can include C headers in C++ code using extern "C", which prevents C++ name mangling and allows C functions to be called from C++.
2) Python/C API: Allows embedding Python code in C++ applications or extending Python with C++ modules. It involves direct calls to Python C API functions.
3) Boost.Python: A library that simplifies interoperability between C++ and Python by providing a more convenient API for binding C++ classes and functions to Python.
4) pybind11: A lightweight header-only library that provides seamless interoperability between C++11 and Python.
5) Java Native Interface (JNI): Allows C++ code to call Java methods and vice versa. This requires writing native methods in Java and implementing them in C++.
6) P/Invoke: Platform Invocation Services allow calling C++ functions from C#. The C++ functions must be exported using extern "C".
7) WebAssembly allows C++ code to run on web browsers by compiling C++ code to a binary format that can be executed in web environments. This is useful for web applications needing high-performance computing.
