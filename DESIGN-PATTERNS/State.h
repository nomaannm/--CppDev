/*
 * State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
 * It appears as if the object changed its class. The State pattern is closely related to the concept
 * of a Finite-State Machine
 * The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all
 * state-specific behaviors into these classes.
 * Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object, called context, stores a reference to
 * one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all the state-related work to that object.
 * The buttons and switches in your smartphone behave differently depending on the current state of the device:
 *     When the phone is unlocked, pressing buttons leads to executing various functions.
 *     When the phone is locked, pressing any button leads to the unlock screen.
 *     When the phoneâ€™s charge is low, pressing any button shows the charging screen.
