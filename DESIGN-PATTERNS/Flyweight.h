/*
 * The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern aimed at reducing the memory footprint of an application by sharing objects that
 * are similar in nature. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you need to create a large number of objects that share common data but differ
 * in some attributes.
 * Components
   Flyweight: The interface that defines the methods for working with shared data. It can be either abstract or an interface, and it
   usually defines methods for managing intrinsic state.
   ConcreteFlyweight: Implements the Flyweight interface and represents the objects that can be shared. It stores the intrinsic state of
   the object.
   FlyweightFactory: Creates and manages flyweight objects. It ensures that flyweights are shared properly and that clients use shared
   instances whenever possible.
   Client: Uses the FlyweightFactory to obtain flyweight instances and maintains the extrinsic state of the object

 * Use Cases
   Graphics: When rendering a large number of objects that have the same appearance but differ in position or other attributes.
   Text Editors: When displaying a large number of characters or words where many characters are the same.
   Game Development: For managing large numbers of similar game objects efficiently.
