/*
 * Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing
 * the details of its implementation.
 * The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in software development to capture and restore the state of an
 * object without violating its encapsulation. It allows an object to save its internal state so that it can be restored
 * later, providing a way to implement undo/redo functionality.
 * Key Components of the Memento Pattern:
            Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored. It creates a memento containing a snapshot
            of its current state.

            Memento: A value object that acts as a snapshot of the Originator's state. It is typically immutable and only
            the Originator has access to it. The Memento stores the internal state of the Originator.

            Caretaker: Manages the mementos, keeping track of the originatorâ€™s state history. It is responsible for
            requesting a Memento from the Originator, storing it, and possibly restoring the Originator's state from
            a Memento at a later time.
